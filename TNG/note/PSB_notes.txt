Notes from SFH
138265
152693 (might be later)
172175 - alpha-tform plot looks good at [Fe/H]=-0.25
173605
176051 - alpha-tform good at [Fe/H]=-0.25
178140 - some structure, very complicated
181911 - lots of wiggles
184627 - alpha/Fe decreases pretty strongly
185253 - lots of spikes but no dips, alpha-tform should be replotted
193025 - nice ramps and decreasing alpha
197301 - some gaps and descending alpha
201842 - 
202938 - pretty strong decline in alpha, some gaps
208817 - some wiggles but also doesnt return to pre-dip behavior?
218213 - make this one at slightly lower z
226914 - some wiggles/ramps
233856 - lots of burst/dip, but am i plotting this at the correct FeH?
241728 - burst and dip, relative quiescent but not strong
246391 - burst in sfh but no dip in alpha
246755 - burst and associated downramp at Feh=0
248052 - downramp but almost a reset of alpha
259312 - nice spike in sfh associated with spike in alpha, but not really a gap
260347 - 
262670
265671
266628
269775 - small gap in sfh, but alpha not declining enough to matter
269914 - quiescent phase with dip and recovery, but again alpha not declining fast enough
292983 - 
307826 - strong decline with lots of structure
321390 - same

Notes from plane
138265 - some weird structure though not necessarily a bimodality
145447 - a bimodality, but the modes dont overlap in Fe so it doesnt show up in 1D hist
147367 - some structure at FeH=-0.5
155133 - a little bit of structure, seems correlated with gap in SFH at given FeH
168294 - maybe a touch of a bimodality at high FeH
172175 - a baby bimodality at high FeH
173605 - bimodality at low FeH, no structure at higher FeH
178140 - some real weird shells and stuff, esp at FeH=0
179803 - very nice bimodality at FeH=-0.25
184627 - a little bit of structure but no multimodality
186577 - a little bit of forking behavior at high FeH
193025 - very nice bimodality
194867 - bimodality at FeH=-0.5, from sfh maybe dilution?
201002 - some wild wild structure
201842 - some nice bimodality at low FeH
202938 - some bimodalities at lower FeH, has associated gaps w/ decline in alpha
204085 - really weird hook thing? need to look at even higher FeH
208817 - TONS of structure, lots of little gaps in conditional SFH
211773 - very strong bimodality at -0.25
216482 - strong bimodality at -0.25, sfh looks a bit weird at that FeH
218213 - lower sequence is just forming!! look at lower z!
222061 - at FeH=-0.75 a little bit of structure, marginally bimodal
224515 - hint of structure at FeH=-0.75
224995 - strong bimodality, with a tilted up feature? no clear gap in SFH
226914 - weak bimodality, probably will be stronger at lower z
233558 - weak but clear biomdality at -0.25
233856 - def has structure, also in SFH
241728 - def some structure, though not strong bimodal. associated with STRONG starburst
246391 - def bimolda at low FeH, something weird at high FeH too
246755 - biomdal at -0.25
249507 - little bit of bimodal at -0.5
255629 - weird spray of dist, goes to very high FeH
259312 - seems to have a bimodality, but not in 1D hist - has a starburst
262670 - def has two sequences
266628 - seems to have two sequences that connect at higher FeH, this one has a weird SFH
267462 - some structure for sure, but no strong multimodality
270786 - weird extension to high FeH
287601 - hint of structure at -0.5
292983 - a little extension at around -1, not strong in 1D
307826 - really weird stuff going on, lots of shells and ridges
321390 - extension to high FeH as well, large SF burst at early times




TODO
218213 at lower z
179803 need to make more plots, looks interesting
201842 is strong candidate for PSB/quenching mechanism
211773 look at more closely, wild structure
241728 look at more closely, clear starburst and conditional SFH have clear quiescence - good candidate
246391 look at more closely, has bimodality
208817 look at more closely, tons and tons of structure
